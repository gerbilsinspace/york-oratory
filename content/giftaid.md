    Yes, I am a UK Tax Payer and I would like the York Oratory to reclaim the
    tax on this donation. I understand that if I pay less Income Tax and / or
    Capital Gains Tax than the amount of Gift Aid claimed on all my donations in
    that tax year it is my responsibility to pay any difference.
