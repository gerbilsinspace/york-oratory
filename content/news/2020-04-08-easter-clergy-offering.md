Dear Parishioner and Supporter,

I hope you won't mind if I make a rather more direct appeal this year for support for the Easter Clergy Offering.

Every year we rely on the generosity of our congregation for the financial support of the parish and the community. This year there will be very little to go round. This is particularly hard for our brothers who do not even have Mass stipends. They are working very hard to make sure that all our services are streamed on the internet. We have over five hundred subscribers and many people participate in these services live or watch them later.

We intend to ask people to make standing orders for the long term support during the present lockdown. It has taken some time to do this as we were in the process of opening a new community bank account when the present situation began. All this had to wait until we became independent and were able to establish our own charitable trust. As you know these things only happened in the first months of the year.

Meanwhile if you would like to make a one-off gift to the Easter Clergy Offering, please contact Br Adam, our Father Treasurer, by [clicking here](mailto:finance@yorkoratory.com). He will send you the account details for an online donation.

I know we are not alone in facing financial uncertainty so we are grateful for whatever help you are able to provide. We have been much encouraged by the many positive messages we have received in support of the online services.

Wishing you all a recollected and holy Triduum and a joyful and blessed Easter,

Fr Richard

Provost of the York Oratory
