After having had his election as Archbishop of York confirmed (by Zoom!), Dr Stephen Cottrell's first act was to make a pilgrimage to the Shrine of St Margaret Clitherow on the Shambles, accompanied by his wife, Rebecca, and the Dean of York Minster, Rt Revd Dr Jonathan Frost. There he was welcomed (in a socially-distant manner) by our own Bishop, Rt Revd Terence Patrick Drainey, Bishop of Middlesbrough. They then prayed together in the Shrine, before the Anglican party returned to the Minster.
