For 50 years an unjust destruction of human life has been taking place on our doorsteps and is being funded by our taxes. 56 Million lives are destroyed by the barbarism of abortion globally each year. No longer is heart disease or cancer the greatest cause of fatalities in the world. No, this prize goes tragically to Abortion. The life of the child in the womb, which in God’s designs, should be the safest place imaginable, has now become the place most dangerous for survival. We are living in a modern day “Holocaust”.

In the year 2007, an international organization called 40 Days for Life was formed to help bring about an end to abortion through the methods of prayer, sacrifice, and street witness. Thanks to these campaigns, it is estimated that in the past 14 years, 17,226 unborn children have been spared from the evil of abortion alongside the closure of many abortion facilities throughout the world. And so this year, we are hoping to run our own 40 Days for Life campaign in York at the BPAS Unity health, 18 Wenlock Terrace, York YO10 4DU from the 23rd September until 1st November, daily from 8am to 8pm – and we would like to invite you to get involved in this campaign and battle for life!

There are two ways you can get yourself involved in this campaign. Firstly, by pledging to offer up prayer and fasting for the intentions of the 40 Days for Life campaign, asking God to bless and protect all those mothers and children who are in danger of abortion and its painful consequences. Secondly, is by offering a few hours of your time over the 40-day period to join us in praying the Holy Rosary with Our Lady outside the BPAS Abortion Centre to be a visible witness and defender of human life from conception. This may sound daunting for some of you but know that many graces can be won in this battle for life by courageously stepping out onto the streets under the protection of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Patroness of the Pro-Life Movement.

We have the legal right to pray peacefully outside of this Abortion Centre. The Police are always fully informed, and the Vigil Coordinator makes sure that each hour of prayer has at least 2 participants. Pope St. John Paul II said at the 8th World Youth Day in Denver in 1993, “Do not be afraid to go out on the streets and into public places, like the first Apostles who preached Christ and the Good News of salvation in the squares of cities, towns and villages. This is no time to be ashamed of the Gospel (Rom 1,16). It is the time to preach it from the rooftops (Matt 10,27)”. We will be handing out flyers and collecting your details after Holy Mass on 23rdAugust 2020. Please be generous in support of this witness for LIFE. Your generosity will save LIVES.
