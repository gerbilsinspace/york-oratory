* *Social distancing should still be followed in church. Please keep your distance from those who do not live in the same household, follow the one-way system around the church, sanitize your hands upon entering and leaving, and follow any instructions given by our volunteers.*
* *For the time being, Holy Communion will not be given at Mass.*
* *Congregational Singing is not permitted and so all Masses will be Low Masses for now.*
* *The Shrine of St Margaret Clitherow remains closed at the moment.*
* *Those Masses which are live-streamed will have only the sanctuary broadcast.*
* *We are not currently allowed to make lavatories available.*
* *All of these arrangements will be kept under review.*
