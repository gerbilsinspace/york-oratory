##### Message from the Treasurer

On behalf of the York Oratory I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to the very generous Easter Clergy offering; this collection forms a major part of our individual incomes and we are truly grateful for you generosity.

I would also like to thank all those who have donated or continue to donate to either the Oratory or the Parish.

We all greatly appreciate this very practical sign of your continued support, as well as all of the many kind messages we have received.

It is thanks to your support that we are able to continue praying for the city and will hopefully be able to re-open our churches soon without fear of financial ruin due to the lockdown.

St Joseph's and St Wilfrid's are both run by the York Oratory, this means that there are separate legal organisations with separate bank accounts, and different way to donate to these accounts. In order to help you stay informed about where your donations are going we have prepared a brief information sheet which also describes the different ways possible for you to donate to us, and so information of Mass Intentions.

The sheet can be downloaded [here](https://yorkoratory.com/media/How%20to%20donate.pdf).

There are several options so please have a look and decide which is most suited to your circumstances. There is also some brief information on our [donations page](https://yorkoratory.com/donation).

Once again thank you for your support.
