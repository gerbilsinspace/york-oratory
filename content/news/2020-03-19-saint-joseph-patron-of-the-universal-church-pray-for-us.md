Today is the feast of Saint Joseph, Husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Foster Father of Jesus Christ, and Patron of the Universal Church. He is also the patron of our parish of St Joseph.



Today Mass was celebrated in the parish church for the intentions of all the parishioners of St Joseph. After Mass, the new statue on the front of the church was blessed. It was sculpted by Rudi Bolcar, with generous funding from the Tyburn Trust.

As St Joseph protected and guarded the Holy Family from all danger, so may he preserve and defend us in the trials of these days. May his image on the front of St Joseph's Church be a reminder to us to continue trusting in God's Providence and Mercy.
