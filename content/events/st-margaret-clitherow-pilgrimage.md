Practical Information

Transport:

Train- We recommend pilgrims coming from outside the city use the train if possible. The railway station is approximately 10 minutes walk from both the Bar Convent and St Wilfrid's church respectively.

Car- Please be aware that parking in York is expensive and the roads can become very congested especially on Saturdays. The closest car park to the Bar Convent is Nunnery Lane car park and is just across the road from the Convent. Parking outside St Wilfrid's church is restricted; the closest car parks are Marygate, then Esplanade, and Foss Bank; all within ten minutes walk.

Bus- There are bus stops close to both the Bar Convent and St Wilfrid's church; York also has a 'park and ride' scheme. See the council's website for more information https://www.itravelyork.info/buses

Coach- Any pilgrim groups arriving by coach are asked to contact us.

The Bar Convent:

Space is limited in the convent chapel so large groups are asked to contact us first. The convent also has a museum and a cafe which pilgrims may wish to allow extra time to visit. See their website for more information http://www.bar-convent.org.uk/

Procession:

The processional route is approximately one mile taken at a slow pace. York pavements can be uneven and crowded so we ask that you take care.

The procession stops at various stations for short prayers. These are: Micklegate Bar, Ouse Bridge, The Shambles, Kings Manor, St Wilfrid's Church.
