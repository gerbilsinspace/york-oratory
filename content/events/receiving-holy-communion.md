The Fathers and Brothers of the York Oratory would like to thank parishioners and members of the congregation for your patience while we have been working out the best way to receive Holy Communion now that public worship has resumed.

We decided on a phased return to a more normative celebration of Mass beginning with Masses without communion. Once it was clear what the numbers would be like at Mass it became easier to work out what would be the best way to move on the the next stage, making it possible to receive Holy Communion.

We have decided to use [Option Two](https://www.cbcew.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/Guidance-Acts-of-Worship-Mass-v7-070720.pdf)in the guidance issued by the Bishops' Conference. Holy Communion will be given in St Philip's Chapel at St Wilfrid's and in the Lady Chapel at St Joseph's after the final blessing of every Mass. There will be a brief pause while the celebrant returns to the sacristy to sanitise his hands. Precise instructions will be given at the end of each Mass, at least until we get used to the new procedure, and a steward will be on hand to guide you.

If you are at all unsure about receiving Holy Communion please be reassured that there is not - and never has been - any obligation to receive Holy Communion at every Mass and that you probably should not receive if you think you are at all vulnerable. It is always possible to make a [spiritual communion](https://aleteia.org/2018/09/20/cant-receive-the-eucharist-heres-how-to-make-a-spiritual-communion/).
