St Josephâ€™s Church was built in the 1930s and became an independent parish serving the Catholics of the growing suburbs of Clifton, Clifton Without and Rawcliffe. Its tower was damaged during the war by a pilot who lost his life trying avoid housing while landing his badly damaged plane on the nearby Clifton Airfield. There is a memorial to him in the porch of the church.
