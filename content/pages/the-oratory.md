The Oratory is a Catholic religious institute made up of priests and brothers who live and pray together. The first Oratory was started in Rome in 1575 by St Philip Neri, and the first English Oratory was set up in 1848 by St John Henry Newman in Birmingham.

The word ‘Oratory’ means place of prayer; prayer is essential and it is only by spending time with God that we can come close to Him.

_Domus mea domus orationis vocabitur_

My house shall be called a house of prayer
