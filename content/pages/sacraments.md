## Baptisms

If you would like to arrange for your child to be baptised, please contact the Parish Priest. He will want to meet you to get to know you, talk about baptism, and make sure you are familiar with the rite. An important point to bear in mind is that you will need at least one Catholic godparent (ideally two) for the baptism.

If you do not live or worship regularly in our parish and would like to arrange a baptism at St Wilfrid's or St Joseph's, you will need to talk to your own local Parish Priest so that he can give permission for the baptism to take place in our church.

Here is a letter for you to download and print for your Parish Priest to sign if he agrees to the baptism taking place outside his parish.

If you are an adult who has not been baptised, and are interested in learning more about the Catholic faith, please get in touch with the Parish Priest.

The full text of the Baptism Rite can be found here together with a selection of readings suitable for a baptism. You might want to choose one or two of them.

## **Weddings**

If you are thinking of getting married, it is nearly always necessary to give at least six months' notice, and preferably more. This is to make sure that all the civil formalities and spiritual preparations can be completed in good time.

You need to visit the register office in the place where each of you lives in order to notify the civil registrar of your intention to marry and to get the blue certificates without which the priest will not be able to marry you. This MUST be done a month before your wedding but you should make a visit at the earliest opportunity to discuss the civil formalities with the registrar.

This link provides a good guide to the practicalities of getting married.

The Church law requires that couples marrying in a Catholic church are well prepared to receive the sacrament. The Code of Canon Law (§1063) states this as follows:

Pastors of souls are obliged to take care that their ecclesiastical community offers the Christian faithful the assistance by which the matrimonial state is preserved in a Christian spirit and advances in perfection. This assistance must be offered especially by….   personal preparation to enter marriage, which disposes the spouses to the holiness and duties of their new state…… and a fruitful liturgical celebration of marriage which is to show that the spouses signify and share in the mystery of the unity and fruitful love between Christ and the Church.

In addition to the regular meetings with the priest who will conduct the wedding ceremony couples are also required to complete an approved course of Catholic marriage preparation. At St Wilfrid's and St Joseph's marriage preparation is completed through a combination of online resources, meetings with mentor couples and organised marriage preparation days tailored to suit the needs of the individual couple.

This will be set up once you have had an initial meeting with the priest.

If neither one of you lives in the parish of St Wilfrid's or St Joseph's, York you will need the permission of your own Parish Priest. When only one of you is Catholic that will be the Parish Priest of the Catholic partner. If in doubt check with the Parish Priest.

Here is a letter for you to download and print for your Parish Priest to sign if he agrees to your wedding taking place outside his parish.

The Marriage Service is a Sacrament of the Church, a solemn exchange of vows between a bride and a groom. It is an act of worship to offer thanksgiving and praise to God for his blessing on the couple’s life together as husband and wife.  All the music before, during and after the wedding liturgy reflects the Christian meaning of the rite.  All music must be clearly and unambiguously sacred and taken from the repertoire of church music. The priest celebrating the wedding will be able to guide you.

Please note that in accordance with §393 of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal for England and Wales recorded music is not permitted in church nor secular music of any kind.

Sacred music is sung prayer, music that has been created in petition or thanksgiving to God. The wedding reception is the place for music from popular culture or favourite pieces that have been significant in your relationship.

Our musicians rely for their income on weddings and funerals. If you would like your own musicians to play at your wedding this must be with the agreement of the Director of Music. A fee is charged for each musician at the same rate that our own musicians are paid.

For all information about music at your wedding, please contact the Director of Music, Dr John Ridgeway-Wood.

Here are some useful documents to help you prepare for your wedding. Please click on the links.

## **First Holy Communion and Confirmation**

Courses are run each year to prepare children and young people to make their First Confession and First Holy Communion (at about age seven) or to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation (at about age thirteen). The courses usually begin in September and continue until the early summer. For more information please contact the Parish Priest.

For an application form for Confirmation preparation please click here.

## Interested in becoming a Catholic?

Each year we receive a number of people into the Catholic Church. Some of them are Christians who have already been baptised and now wish to enter into full communion with the Church; others have never been baptised.

If you are interested in becoming a Catholic, one of the best first steps is to start attending Mass — you can always come to the front during Holy Communion and ask for a blessing. Find out more about the Catholic Faith by talking with Catholic friends and colleagues, or ask to see a priest. Above all, try to pray regularly.

From September to Pentecost we run a course for those interested in becoming Catholics; but it is also possible to receive instruction on an individual basis with one of the priests.

If you would like to know more, please contact the Parish Priest.

## Hospitals and visits to the sick

**Home visits for the sick**

If you are ill and housebound, or have a relative or friend who is, please contact the Parish Priest who will arrange for a visit. Holy Communion can be brought regularly to those who are ill and housebound in our parish who are unable to attend Mass.

**Going into hospital?**

If you are going into hospital, please contact the Parish Priest in order to receive the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick before you go in. He can also let the Hospital Chaplain know so that you will be visited while you are there.

**In an emergency**

If a relative is in imminent danger of death and would like to see a priest please call 01904 624767

**The seriously sick and the dying**

At times we have to face the anxiety of serious illness, either for ourselves or for those we love. The Catholic Bishops of England and Wales have a helpful and understanding website. The priests, brothers and parish visitors at St Joseph's and St Wilfrid's are here to offer help and consolation in any way we can so please do not hesitate to get in touch.

## Funerals

Please contact the Parish Priest if you need to arrange a funeral. The funeral director will make all the arrangements on your behalf including payments for the church and the music.

Please note that in accordance with §393 of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal for England and Wales recorded music is not permitted in church nor secular music of any kind. In accordance with paragraph 346 (a) and 346 (e) of the same document the colours purple or black are normative for Funeral Masses, the exception being the colour white which is worn for the Funeral Masses of those (of any age) who have not attained the age of reason.

The General Instruction of the Roman Missal §382 forbids a eulogy or a tribute to the deceased at a Funeral Mass. The homily (sermon) will speak of the hope which the death and resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ gives to the faithful through his Church. When a family member or close friend would like to say a few words about the person they have lost then this may take place at the end of Mass and before the final prayers.

If you are arranging a funeral here are some suggested readings.
