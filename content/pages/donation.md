description: How to donate to the York Oratory
---
Donations sent to the York Oratory are used to support the York Oratory clergy and our mission.

##### \-Online Donations-

We are currently working on setting this up. For single donations you might consider either a cheque or a bank transfer.

##### \-Mass Intentions-

Donations for Mass intentions go directly to the priest who says the Mass.  The easiest way to administer this is if you place a cash donation in an envelope with the details of the Mass intention and post it through our letter box (11 High Petergate, YO1 7EN). A list of Mass intentions is published each week on our website.

We are working on a system to accept online donations for Mass Intentions.

##### \-Cheque-

Cheques payable to the York Oratory can be sent to 11 High Petergate, York, YO1 7EN.

##### \-Standing Order and Bank Transfers-

Please [contact us](https://yorkoratory.com/contact) to request information about setting up a standing order or a Bank Transfer.

#### Parish

Please note that the York Oratory is a separate entity from the parishes that we serve and the Diocese of Middlesbrough. If you wish to donate for a specific fundraising appeal, parish, or would like more information please [contact us.](https://yorkoratory.com/contact)
