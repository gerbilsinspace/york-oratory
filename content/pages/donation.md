description: How to donate to the York Oratory
---
Donations sent to the York Oratory are used to support the York Oratory clergy and our mission.

##### \-Online Donations-

To make an online payment to the York Oratory please click [here](https://yorkoratory.com/donate/). This is a good option for one-off donations; if you want to regularly give to the York Oratory please consider setting up a Standing Order or using a Bank Transfer.

##### \-Mass Intentions-

Donations for Mass intentions go directly to the priest who says the Mass.  The easiest way to administer this is if you place a cash donation in an envelope with the details of the Mass intention and post it through our letter box (11 High Petergate, YO1 7EN). 

If this isn't possible, then you can request a Mass Intention and donate online by clicking [here](https://yorkoratory.com/donate/). Make sure to write your intention in the ‘Mass Intention’ box. Please note that due to the costs of administering online payments the minimum donation possible is £10.

A list of Mass intentions is published each week on our website.

##### \-Cheque-

Cheques payable to the York Oratory can be sent to 11 High Petergate, York, YO1 7EN.

##### \-Standing Order and Bank Transfers-

Please [contact us](https://yorkoratory.com/contact) to request information about setting up a standing order or a Bank Transfer. These are the best ways to make regular or semi-regular payments as they are both secure and don’t incur banking fees.

#### Parish

Please note that the York Oratory is a separate entity from the parishes that we serve and the Diocese of Middlesbrough. If you wish to donate for a specific fundraising appeal, parish, or would like more information please [contact us.](https://yorkoratory.com/contact)
