description: How to donate to the York Oratory
---
Donations sent to the York Oratory are used to support the York Oratory clergy and our mission.

\-Online Donations-

We are currently working on setting this up

\-Mass Intentions-

Donations for Mass intentions go directly to the priest who says the Mass.  The easiest way to administer this is if you place a cash donation in an envelope with the details of the Mass intention and post it through our letter box (11 High Petergate, YO1 7EN).
A list of Mass intentions is published each week on our website.

We are working on a system to accept online donations for Mass Intentions.

\-Cheque-

Cheques payable to the York Oratory can be sent to 11 High Petergate, York, YO1 7EN.

\-Standing Order-
