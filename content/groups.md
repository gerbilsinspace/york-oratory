      The Oratory began in Rome with a group of men who met informally in St
      Philip’s rooms for prayer, recreation and spiritual guidance from the
      saint of joy. The community of priests which we now call “the Oratory” was
      formed later to care for the spiritual needs of this group as it outgrew
      St Philip’s rooms and became known in Rome and around the world. But it
      was the laymen’s group that came first. Wherever the Oratory is to be
      found this informal origin is recalled by the Brothers of the Secular
      Oratory. Brothers continue to meet regularly with the same goal, growth in
      holiness in the way of St Philip. Not currently meeting but please contact
      Fr Stephen if you would be interested in restarting it.

      Meets on the 1st Monday of each month. There is adoration at 11:30am
      followed by Mass and the Blessing with the relic of St Philip. There will
      be some social time after in the Upper Room. Please bring your own lunch.
      This is a wonderful opportunity for women to come together and pray and
      enjoy some social time. New members are always welcome.

      This group meets most Monday evening at 7:30pm from September until
      Pentecost to help people deepen their understanding of the Catholic faith.
      Catholics who want to share their faith or to get to know it better are
      welcome to come to help others who may wish to become Catholics through
      the Rite of Christian Initiation or by being received into full communion
      with the Catholic Church. Each meeting includes a systematic presentation
      of Catholic teaching together with opportunities for prayer, questions,
      and meeting other Catholics and enquirers. We end most evenings with the
      Office of Compline sung in church.


      In the year 2018/2019 we will be using the Evangelium Course.


      Please contact the Parish Priest to find out more.

      We are always looking for musicians to enhance our Sunday liturgy.


      There is a small choir to support the singing at the 10:30am Sunday Mass.
      We have hymns, simple motets and congregational Mass settings. We are
      looking for both male and female voices. Please contact Br Adam for
      information.


      At the 12:00pm Latin Mass we have the Schola Sancti Wilfridi a traditional
      choir that sings plainchant and polyphony. Singers are also welcome to
      support the Fathers at Sung Latin Vespers on Sundays at 4:00pm.


      We also award four choral scholarships each year, one in each voice, to
      sing classical church music at the 12 noon Sunday Latin Mass and at
      Vespers and Benediction. To find out more about these, please contact the
      Director of Music, Dr John Ridgeway-Wood.


      Please let us know if you would be interested in helping with our music.
