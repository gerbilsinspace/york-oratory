      The Oratory began in Rome with a group of men who met informally in St
      Philip’s rooms for prayer, recreation and spiritual guidance from the
      saint of joy. The community of priests which we now call “the Oratory” was
      formed later to care for the spiritual needs of this group as it outgrew
      St Philip’s rooms and became known in Rome and around the world. But it
      was the laymen’s group that came first. Wherever the Oratory is to be
      found this informal origin is recalled by the Brothers of the Secular
      Oratory. Brothers continue to meet regularly with the same goal, growth in
      holiness in the way of St Philip.


      Currently Brothers meets on Sundays from 5-6pm at St Wilfrid's church.


      Typically we meet in the upper room for a cup of tea and around half an
      hour's recreation time; afterwards we go into the church for a short
      spiritual talk and then sing Compline (the Church's night prayer) by
      candlelight. Brothers is a very good way for Catholic men to meet other
      committed Catholics and to gain some support in one's spiritual life.


      If you are interested in finding out more then you can simply turn up to
      one of the meetings and make yourself known, or speak to Br Adam.


      Those who regularly attend the meetings may be invited to be enrolled in
      Brothers; this makes one part of the spiritual family of St Philip
      (similar to a third order in other religious communities).


      Brothers doesn't meet in August.

      Meets on the 1st Monday of each month. There is adoration at 11:30am
      followed by Mass and the Blessing with the relic of St Philip. There will
      be some social time after in the Upper Room. Please bring your own lunch.
      This is a wonderful opportunity for women to come together and pray and
      enjoy some social time. New members are always welcome.

      Meets on Wednesdays from 4-5pm during term time. It is a great way for
      Catholic teenagers to meet other Catholics the same age. We focus on
      building friendships, supporting an active prayer-life, learning about the
      Faith, and helping in the Church.


      Typically we start to gather in the upper room of St Wilfrid's church, and
      the meeting begins properly in St Philip's chapel with the Gospel reading
      for the day, followed by a short spiritual talk. The activities afterwards
      vary from week to week, and are a varied as cleaning the church, competing
      in quiz, cooking pancakes, Confessions, Adoration of the Most Blessed
      Sacrament, playing board games, and having talks.


      This group is for both boys and girls.


      _"For young men to make sure of persevering, it is absolutely necessary
      that they should avoid wicked companions, and be familiar with good
      ones."_ - St Philip Neri


      Please talk to Br Adam if you are interested in joining.
