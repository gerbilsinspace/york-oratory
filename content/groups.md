      The Oratory began in Rome with a group of men who met informally in St
      Philip’s rooms for prayer, recreation and spiritual guidance from the
      saint of joy. The community of priests which we now call “the Oratory” was
      formed later to care for the spiritual needs of this group as it outgrew
      St Philip’s rooms and became known in Rome and around the world. But it
      was the laymen’s group that came first. Wherever the Oratory is to be
      found this informal origin is recalled by the Brothers of the Secular
      Oratory. Brothers continue to meet regularly with the same goal, growth in
      holiness in the way of St Philip. Not currently meeting but please contact
      Fr Stephen if you would be interested in restarting it.

      Meets on the 1st Monday of each month. There is adoration at 11:30am
      followed by Mass and the Blessing with the relic of St Philip. There will
      be some social time after in the Upper Room. Please bring your own lunch.
      This is a wonderful opportunity for women to come together and pray and
      enjoy some social time. New members are always welcome.

      elsewhere in the city. If you would like to help with this work please
