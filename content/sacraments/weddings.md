If you are thinking of getting married, it is nearly always necessary to give at least six months’ notice, and preferably more. This is to make sure that all the civil formalities and spiritual preparations can be completed in good time.



You need to visit the register office in the place where each of you lives in order to notify the civil registrar of your intention to marry and to get the blue certificates without which the priest will not be able to marry you. This MUST be done a month before your wedding but you should make a visit at the earliest opportunity to discuss the civil formalities with the registrar.



This link provides a good guide to the practicalities of getting married.



The Church law requires that couples marrying in a Catholic church are well prepared to receive the sacrament. The Code of Canon Law (§1063) states this as follows:



Pastors of souls are obliged to take care that their ecclesiastical community offers the Christian faithful the assistance by which the matrimonial state is preserved in a Christian spirit and advances in perfection. This assistance must be offered especially by…. personal preparation to enter marriage, which disposes the spouses to the holiness and duties of their new state…… and a fruitful liturgical celebration of marriage which is to show that the spouses signify and share in the mystery of the unity and fruitful love between Christ and the Church.



In addition to the regular meetings with the priest who will conduct the wedding ceremony couples are also required to complete an approved course of Catholic marriage preparation. At St Wilfrid’s and St Joseph’s marriage preparation is completed through a combination of online resources, meetings with mentor couples and organised marriage preparation days tailored to suit the needs of the individual couple.



This will be set up once you have had an initial meeting with the priest.



If neither one of you lives in the parish of St Wilfrid’s or St Joseph’s, York you will need the permission of your own Parish Priest. When only one of you is Catholic that will be the Parish Priest of the Catholic partner. If in doubt check with the Parish Priest.



Here is a letter for you to download and print for your Parish Priest to sign if he agrees to your wedding taking place outside his parish.



The Marriage Service is a Sacrament of the Church, a solemn exchange of vows between a bride and a groom. It is an act of worship to offer thanksgiving and praise to God for his blessing on the couple’s life together as husband and wife. All the music before, during and after the wedding liturgy reflects the Christian meaning of the rite. All music must be clearly and unambiguously sacred and taken from the repertoire of church music. The priest celebrating the wedding will be able to guide you.



Please note that in accordance with §393 of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal for England and Wales recorded music is not permitted in church nor secular music of any kind.



Sacred music is sung prayer, music that has been created in petition or thanksgiving to God. The wedding reception is the place for music from popular culture or favourite pieces that have been significant in your relationship.



Our musicians rely for their income on weddings and funerals. If you would like your own musicians to play at your wedding this must be with the agreement of the Director of Music. A fee is charged for each musician at the same rate that our own musicians are paid.



For all information about music at your wedding, please contact the Director of Music, Dr John Ridgeway-Wood.
