Please contact the Parish Priest if you need to arrange a funeral. The funeral director will make all the arrangements on your behalf including payments for the church and the music.



Please note that in accordance with ยง393 of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal for England and Wales recorded music is not permitted in church nor secular music of any kind. In accordance with paragraph 346 (a) and 346 (e) of the same document the colours purple or black are normative for Funeral Masses, the exception being the colour white which is worn for the Funeral Masses of those (of any age) who have not attained the age of reason.



The General Instruction of the Roman Missal ยง382 forbids a eulogy or a tribute to the deceased at a Funeral Mass. The homily (sermon) will speak of the hope which the death and resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ gives to the faithful through his Church. When a family member or close friend would like to say a few words about the person they have lost then this may take place at the end of Mass and before the final prayers.



If you are arranging a funeral here are some suggested readings.
