## Home visits for the sick

If you are ill and housebound, or have a relative or friend who is, please contact the Parish Priest who will arrange for a visit. Holy Communion can be brought regularly to those who are ill and housebound in our parish who are unable to attend Mass.

## Going into hospital?

If you are going into hospital, please contact the Parish Priest in order to receive the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick before you go in. He can also let the Hospital Chaplain know so that you will be visited while you are there.

## In an emergency

If a relative is in imminent danger of death and would like to see a priest please call 01904 624767

## The seriously sick and the dying

At times we have to face the anxiety of serious illness, either for ourselves or for those we love. The Catholic Bishops of England and Wales have a helpful and understanding website. The priests, brothers and parish visitors at St Joseph’s and St Wilfrid’s are here to offer help and consolation in any way we can so please do not hesitate to get in touch.
