If you would like to arrange for your child to be baptised, please contact the Parish Priest. He will want to meet you to get to know you, talk about baptism, and make sure you are familiar with the rite. An important point to bear in mind is that you will need at least one Catholic godparent (ideally two) for the baptism.

If you do not live or worship regularly in our parish and would like to arrange a baptism at St Wilfrid’s or St Joseph’s, you will need to talk to your own local Parish Priest so that he can give permission for the baptism to take place in our church.

Here is a letter for you to download and print for your Parish Priest to sign if he agrees to the baptism taking place outside his parish.

If you are an adult who has not been baptised, and are interested in learning more about the Catholic faith, please get in touch with the Parish Priest.

The full text of the Baptism Rite can be found here together with a selection of readings suitable for a baptism. You might want to choose one or two of them.
