Each year we receive a number of people into the Catholic Church. Some of them are Christians who have already been baptised and now wish to enter into full communion with the Church; others have never been baptised.

If you are interested in becoming a Catholic, one of the best first steps is to start attending Mass â€” you can always come to the front during Holy Communion and ask for a blessing. Find out more about the Catholic Faith by talking with Catholic friends and colleagues, or ask to see a priest. Above all, try to pray regularly.

From September to Pentecost we run a course for those interested in becoming Catholics; but it is also possible to receive instruction on an individual basis with one of the priests.

If you would like to know more, please contact the Parish Priest.
